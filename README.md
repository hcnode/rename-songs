## Why

I make this CLI because when I play the mp3 music in Camry's player, I found they were played order by artist name and song's name default, 
But I need them to be played by the order of number of track of the albumn.

And I tried to find whether I can change the order type, but I fail. So I make this CLI to change the name of the mp3 file with prefix "00x", so they can be play by the actual order.


## Usages

`npm install rename-songs -g`

goto the folder and run `rename-songs`

it will find the sub-document's mp3 and rename them
